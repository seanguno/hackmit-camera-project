# Persistent Photo Storage Implementation

## Overview
The MentraOS camera app now includes persistent photo storage that saves photos to the file system, ensuring they survive app restarts and providing better data management.

## Storage Structure

```
hackmit-camera-project/
├── storage/
│   └── photos/
│       ├── metadata.json          # Photo metadata and references
│       └── [userId]/              # User-specific folders
│           └── photo_2024-01-15T10-30-45-123Z.jpg
```

## Key Features

### ✅ **Persistent Storage**
- Photos are saved to disk and survive app restarts
- Automatic directory creation for new users
- Metadata tracking for all photos

### ✅ **User Organization**
- Each user gets their own subdirectory
- Photos are organized by user ID
- Easy to manage and backup per user

### ✅ **Smart File Naming**
- Photos are named with timestamps: `photo_2024-01-15T10-30-45-123Z.jpg`
- Automatic file extension detection from MIME type
- No filename conflicts

### ✅ **Memory Efficiency**
- Photos can be loaded from disk when needed
- Buffer is kept in memory for quick access
- Automatic cleanup of old data

## API Endpoints

### **Get Latest Photo**
```http
GET /api/latest-photo
```
Returns metadata about the latest photo including file path.

### **Get Photo Data**
```http
GET /api/photo/:requestId
```
Returns the actual photo image data (loads from file if needed).

### **Get All Photos**
```http
GET /api/photos
```
Returns a list of all photos for the authenticated user.

### **Delete Photo**
```http
DELETE /api/photo/:requestId
```
Deletes both the file and metadata for a photo.

## Implementation Details

### **Storage Methods**
- `initializeStorage()`: Creates directories and loads existing photos
- `savePhotoToFile()`: Saves photo buffer to disk
- `loadPhotoFromFile()`: Loads photo from disk
- `saveMetadata()`: Saves photo metadata to JSON file
- `getPhotoBuffer()`: Smart method that loads from memory or disk

### **Error Handling**
- Graceful fallback to memory-only storage if file operations fail
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Automatic directory creation

### **Data Persistence**
- Photos are automatically saved when captured
- Metadata is updated after each photo save
- Existing photos are loaded on app startup

## Testing

Run the storage test to verify functionality:
```bash
bun test-storage.ts
```

This will check:
- Storage directory existence
- File permissions
- Metadata file validity
- User directory structure

## Benefits for Face Recognition

This persistent storage implementation provides:

1. **Reliable Data Access**: Photos are always available, even after restarts
2. **Easy Integration**: Photo buffers are readily available for face detection APIs
3. **Scalable Storage**: Can handle multiple users and large photo collections
4. **Backup Friendly**: Simple file structure for easy backup and restore
5. **Debugging Support**: Clear file organization and comprehensive logging

## Next Steps

With persistent storage implemented, you can now:

1. **Integrate Face Detection**: Use the photo buffers for face recognition APIs
2. **Build Profile System**: Store and retrieve face recognition results
3. **Add Search Functionality**: Implement reverse image search
4. **Create User Profiles**: Build comprehensive user profiles from photos

The storage system is ready to support your face recognition and profile search features!
