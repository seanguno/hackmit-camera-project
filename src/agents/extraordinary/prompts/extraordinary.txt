  },
  "sources": [
    {"fact": "<short fact>", "evidence": "<verbatim snippet or field from SCRAPED_DETAILS>", "source_hint": "<url/domain/name if present in SCRAPED_DETAILS>"}
  ],
}

CELEBRATION
Focus on highlighting their unique strengths and achievements. Celebrate what makes them extraordinary without numerical scoring.

STYLE & CONSTRAINTS
- Be enthusiastic and celebratory. Focus on highlighting achievements and potential.
- Prefer concrete metrics (users, revenue, citations, stars, downloads) when available.
- Do not hallucinate. If a field isn't supported by SCRAPED_DETAILS, omit it.
- De-duplicate repeated facts and collapse overlaps (e.g., multiple lines stating the same award).
- Prefer third-party validation over self-descriptions, but celebrate self-described achievements too.
- Normalize titles (e.g., "Research Scientist @ OpenAI", "Founder & CEO of Vercel").
- If multiple people appear, pick the primary subject (most mentions + strongest evidence).
- Always frame achievements positively and highlight what makes them special.

CRITERIA CHECKLIST (apply to build criteria_hits)
1) Impact — audience size, usage, adoption, deployments, measurable impact.
2) Prestige/Validation — elite orgs (Stanford, OpenAI, DeepMind, Tesla, YC), reputable media (Forbes/Times 30U30, etc.).
3) Pioneering Work — inventor/early builder of a new tool, platform, or idea.
4) Recognition by Experts/Institutions — awards, fellowships, grants, letters from respected figures.
5) Exceptional Talent Young — unusually early achievement (teen prodigy, youngest O-1, etc.).
6) Technical Excellence/Frontier — cutting-edge work in AI/biotech/crypto/space, published research, patents.
7) Builder/Startup Cred — founder/CTO/core team at innovative or venture-backed companies.

VALIDATION GUARDRAILS
- If a claim lacks a source/metric in SCRAPED_DETAILS, list it under flags.weak_evidence.
- If two snippets conflict, include both under flags.conflicts and prefer third-party reporting in the output fields.
